# HTML and CSS Basics

This project covers fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS, outlining the creation of an HTML page, understanding markup languages, the Document Object Model (DOM), styling with CSS, and adhering to specific requirements. 

## General Information

### What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of elements and tags that define the layout, text, images, and other elements on a webpage.

### How to Create an HTML Page
To create an HTML page, use a text editor such as vi, vim, or emacs to write the HTML code. Save the file with a `.html` extension to view it in a web browser.

### What is a Markup Language?
A markup language like HTML uses tags to annotate elements within a document, providing structure and formatting instructions that browsers interpret to display content.

### What is the DOM?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the document as nodes and objects, allowing scripts to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

### What is an Element/Tag?
An element in HTML represents a structure within a document defined by tags. Tags are used to mark the start and end of elements, encapsulating content and providing structure.

### What is an Attribute?
Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element and are defined within the opening tag. They modify the element's behavior or appearance.

### How Does the Browser Load a Web Page?
The browser parses HTML content from top to bottom, constructing the DOM tree as it encounters elements. It then fetches external resources like CSS and images and renders the webpage accordingly.

### What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a webpage.

### How to Add Style to an Element
Apply styles to HTML elements using CSS properties like `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, etc., either inline or via an external stylesheet.

### What is a Class?
In CSS, a class is a reusable identifier that groups elements, allowing multiple elements to share the same styling.

### What is a Selector?
Selectors in CSS define the elements to which a particular set of styles should be applied. They can target elements by type, class, ID, etc.

### How to Compute CSS Specificity Value
CSS specificity determines which style rule gets applied to an element when multiple rules have conflicting selectors. Specificity is calculated based on the combination of selectors used.

### What are Box Properties in CSS?
Box properties like `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `display` control the visual layout of HTML elements, defining their dimensions, spacing, and borders.

## Requirements

### General Guidelines
- Use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
- Ensure all files end with a new line.
- Maintain a `README.md` file at the project's root.
- Ensure W3C compliance and validate using the W3C Validator.
- Organize CSS files in a `styles` folder.
- Store images in an `images` folder.

### Restrictions
- Avoid using `!important` in CSS.
- Avoid using IDs (`#...`) in the CSS file.
- Refrain from using `img`, `embed`, and `iframe` tags.
- Exclude JavaScript from the project.
- Ensure design adheres to Chrome 56 or later screenshots with no cross-browser considerations.
- Accommodate missing margin/padding as closely as possible to match provided screenshots.

## Screenshots
Screenshots for reference of design and layout are available, designed to align with Chrome 56 or later.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `styles/`: Folder containing CSS files
- `images/`: Folder for storing images

---
This project complies with the specifications outlined and focuses on HTML and CSS fundamentals without the use of JavaScript or cross-browser considerations.
